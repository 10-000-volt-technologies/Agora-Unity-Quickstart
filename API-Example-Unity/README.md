# API-Example-Unity

*__其他语言版本：__  [__简体中文__](README.zh.md)*

The API-Example-Unity project is an open-source demo that will show you different scenes on how to integrate Agora SDK APIs into your project.

Any scene of this project can run successfully alone.

This project contains these scenes:
- audio-sample

- video-sample

- device-manager-sample

- multi-channel-sample

- screenshare-sample

- video-rawdata-sample
  

## Running the App

First, create a developer account at [Agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/), and obtain an App ID.

Then do the following:

1. Clone this repository.

2. Open the project in Unity Editor. Note that you will see compiler errors before you download the SDK package.

3. You may download the SDK package in either of the following two ways:

  

    a. From Unity Asset Store download and import [the Agora Video SDK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/video/agora-video-chat-sdk-for-unity-134502)

    b. Download the ******Agora Gaming SDK****** from [Agora.io SDK](https://docs.agora.io/cn/Agora%20Platform/downloads). Unzip the downloaded SDK package and copy the files from ******samples/Hello-Video-Unity-Agora/Assets/AgoraEngine/****** in SDK to ******API-Example-Unity/Assets/****** in project

4.  Choose one of the scene that you want to run

5.  Fill your App ID into the scene on the game controller (attached on Canvas most likely), like the following example:
  ![api-sample-appid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1261195/89360166-652da380-d67c-11ea-9e67-1e02bbe94fc5.png)
  
Run the game and you are now good to go!
